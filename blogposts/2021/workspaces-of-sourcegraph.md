This started as a design research thread in Slack and escalated into something awesome very quickly! Here are all the workspaces and dev setups of our team.

## Rob Rhyne, Product Designer

- Jetbrains (Webstorm, PHPstorm) (trying to switch to vs code)
- Dark mode
- Material theme, Atom one
- XDebug for php

## Christina Forney, VP Product

- VSCode
- Dark mode
- Sourcegraph dark theme
- Sourcegraph for VSCode, markdownlint, Spell Right
- Desktop organization: Browser on the left with reference material, Sourcegraph, preview of what I'm working on. VSCode on the right on my primary screen. My laptop screen to the right of this has iTerm with split windows. Left pane for git flows, right pane for running whatever thing I'm working on (e.g. this blog post!)

## Alex Russell-Saw, Software Engineer

- Goland
- [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) colour scheme
- Chrome: either for docs or the current feature i'm working on.
- IdeaVim: i'm still in denial that i'm not using Vim anymore, so i've remapped all of Goland's keybinds into vim-style leader key combinations ðŸ™ˆ
- Ultrawide monitor: they're mostly sold for gaming, but i really like using them for productivity, it gives all the benefits of a multi monitor setup without the desk clutter.
- Desktop organization: Using MacOS fullscreen tiling helps keep things focused, i use dedicated desktop spaces for different 'modes' eg working on code, team/company comms, and a dedicated desktop for nonsense like twitter.
