This started as a design research thread in Slack and escalated into something awesome very quickly! Here are all the workspaces and dev setups of our team.

## Rob Rhyne, Product Designer

- Jetbrains (Webstorm, PHPstorm) (trying to switch to vs code)
- Dark mode
- Material theme, Atom one
- XDebug for php

## Christina Forney, VP Product

- VSCode
- Dark mode
- Sourcegraph dark theme
- Sourcegraph for VSCode, markdownlint, Spell Right
- Desktop organization: Browser on the left with reference material, Sourcegraph, preview of what I'm working on. VSCode on the right on my primary screen. My laptop screen to the right of this has iTerm with split windows. Left pane for git flows, right pane for running whatever thing I'm working on (e.g. this blog post!)
